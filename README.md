## Program Description
this code allows the user to input and store a car model, they can also check their list or exit from the script

## Usage
To run the script interactively:
```bash
./cars.sh
```

To test with an input file (for example, `animals-input`):
```bash
./cars.sh < cars-input
```
## How the Script Works
[Explain in 3-5 sentences how your script works. Include information about:]
- The use of the while loop to keep asking for user input
- The case statement that checks the input (1,2,3) 
- How the loop exits when "3" is entered

## Testing Results
[Describe your testing process and results. Include:]
- Example valid inputs you tested numbers between (1,3) and the car name, model, year
- How you used the cars-input file to test, it inputs it into the scrip and sees if it is working correctly by seing the output

## Challenges and Solutions
[Optional: Describe any challenges you encountered while creating this script and how you solved them. This could include debugging issues, understanding case statements, or Git workflow problems.]
